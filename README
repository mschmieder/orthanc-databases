Database plugins for Orthanc
============================


General information
-------------------

This repository contains the source code of various database plugins
for Orthanc, the lightweight, RESTful DICOM server. These plugins
enable Orthanc to store its index and its storage area within
well-known relational databases systems (RDBMS).


Content
-------

* ./Framework/  : code shared by all the plugins
* ./MySQL/      : index and storage plugins for MySQL and MariaDB
* ./PostgreSQL/ : index and storage plugins for PostgreSQL
* ./SQLite/     : index plugin for SQLite (for experimentation)

If you downloaded this project as a versioned release package
(.tar.gz) focused on one given RDBMS, you will only find the folders
that are related to this specific RDBMS. The full source code is
available at:
https://bitbucket.org/sjodogne/orthanc-databases/


Compilation and usage
---------------------

The compilation and usage of the plugins is available in the Orthanc
Book:

* MySQL/MariaDB : http://book.orthanc-server.com/plugins/mysql.html
* PostgreSQL    : http://book.orthanc-server.com/plugins/postgresql.html


Older releases of PostgreSQL
----------------------------

This repository supersedes the older "orthanc-postgresql" repository
that was only focused on PostgreSQL.

Releases <= 2.1 of the PostgreSQL plugins can still be found in the
following legacy repository:
